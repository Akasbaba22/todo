<h2>Security</h2>

<p class="greentext">Men toughened by the weather and faces rugged as a lion’s logged their bags on to the boats.</p>

<p class="greentext">There was much furore as it was done in no particular manner. In an attempt to prevent unauthorized access of classified information, in 1889, the British Government enacted the Official Secrets Act. The word security is very wide and it affects every facet of life.  Literally, security means safety. The Concise Oxford Dictionary, Ninth Edition defines security as a secure condition or feeling. It also defines it as a thing that guards and guarantees. Security according to the same dictionary is the safety of a state, company, etc from espionage, theft or other danger. In the military however, security is defined as the condition achieved when espionage does not take place, subversion does not exist and sabotage is prevented.</p>

In this context, the word ‘document’ is used to describe any form of recorded information. Document security measures therefore cover a wide range of items; notes, letters, maps, charts, drawings, carbons, typing ribbon, films, photographs, vufoil, recording tapes, printing plates and so on.</p>
